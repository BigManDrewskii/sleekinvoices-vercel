## Key Insights from Competitive Analysis

### 1. Wave's Disruptive Free Model
Wave offers **completely free** core accounting and invoicing, making money only on payment processing (2.9% + $0.60) and payroll ($40/month). This is a major competitive threat to SleekInvoices's $12/month model.

**SleekInvoices's Challenge:** Must justify $12/month when Wave is free with similar features.

### 2. Zoho's Feature-Rich Free Tier
Zoho Invoice offers **1,000 free invoices per year** with advanced features like time tracking, expense-to-invoice conversion, and customer portal. This is more generous than SleekInvoices's offering.

**SleekInvoices's Challenge:** Must offer more value than Zoho's free tier to justify $12/month.

### 3. Critical Missing Features in SleekInvoices

**Tier 1 (Must-Have):**
1. **Estimates/Quotes** - All 4 competitors have this
2. **Time Tracking** - FreshBooks, Zoho have this (Wave doesn't)
3. **Expense-to-Invoice Conversion** - Zoho has this
4. **Bank Reconciliation** - Wave, QuickBooks, FreshBooks have this
5. **Aging Reports** - All 4 competitors have this

2. **Inventory Management** - QuickBooks, FreshBooks have this
3. **Multi-user Support** - All competitors have this

3. 🔄 **Better UX** - Opportunity to outshine competitors
4. 🔄 **Niche Focus** - Could target specific industries

### 5. Pricing Strategy Recommendations

**Option A: Stay at $12/month**
- Must add Estimates, Time Tracking, Aging Reports immediately
- Must match Zoho's feature set to justify price
- Risk: Still more expensive than Wave (free) and Zoho (free tier)

**Option B: Introduce Free Tier**
